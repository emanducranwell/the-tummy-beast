            <p class="poem">
                One afternoon I said to <span class="mummy" data-image="Images/mummy.png">mummy</span>,
                “Who is this person in my tummy?
                “Who must be <span class="shrink">small</span> and very <span class="skinny">thin</span>
                “Or how could he have gotten <span class="in"></span>in?”
                My mother said from where she <span class="sat-container"><span class="sat">sat</span></span>,
                “It isn’t nice to talk like that.”
                “It’s true!” I cried. “I <span class="swear">swear</span> it, mummy!
                “There is a person in my <span class="tummy" data-image="Images/fatBoy.png">tummy</span>!
                “He talks to me at night in bed,
                “He’s always asking to be fed,
                “Throughout the day, he screams at me,
                “<a href="link.html">Demanding sugar buns for tea</a>.
                “He tells me it is not a sin
                “To go and raid the biscuit tin.
                “I know quite well it’s awfully wrong
                “To guzzle food the whole day long,
                “But really I can’t help it, mummy,
                “Not with this person in my tummy.”
                “You horrid child!” my mother cried.
                “Admit it right away, you’ve lied!”
                “You’re simply trying to produce
                “A silly asinine excuse!
                “You are the greedy guzzling brat!
                “And that is why you’re always <span class="expand">fat!</span>""
                I tried once more, “Believe me, mummy,
                “There is a person in my tummy.”
                “I’ve had enough!” my mother said,
                “You’d better go at once to bed!”
                Just then, a nicely timed event
                Delivered me from punishment.
                Deep in my tummy something stirred,
                And then an awful noise was heard,
                A snorting grumbling grunting sound
                That made my tummy jump around.
                My darling mother nearly died,
                “My goodness, what was that?” she cried.
                At once the tummy voice came through,
                It shouted, “Hey there! Listen you!
                “I’m getting hungry! I want eats!
                “I want lots of chocs and sweets!
                “Get me half a pound of nuts!
                “Look snappy or I’ll twist your guts!”
                “That’s him!” I cried. “He’s in my tummy!
                “So now do you believe me, mummy?”
                
                But mummy answered nothing more,
                For she had <span class="faint" data-image="Images/mumfainted.png">fainted</span> on the floor.
